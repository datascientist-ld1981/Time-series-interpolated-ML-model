# Time-series-interpolated-ML-model - Supervised and Unsupervised Learnings
# Problem Statemnt
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning models (such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression) on time-series data with interpolation. The objective is to predict future orders based on user activity and timestamps in a dataset. It uses interpolation techniques to fill missing data and improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
This model is designed to predict user behavior and the timing of future orders using time-series data. The dataset contains order timestamps, user IDs, and order details, but lacks direct links between products and orders. Interpolation methods are applied to fill missing timestamps and enhance predictions.
